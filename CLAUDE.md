# WooCommerce BOM & Stock Manager (`wc-bom-stock`)

WordPress plugin adding Bill-of-Materials and component-level stock management to WooCommerce. Owner: the developer ([redacted]).

## Start here

**Read [BUILD_PLAN.md](BUILD_PLAN.md) before writing any code.** It contains the full scope, schema, architecture decisions, and phased build order. This project was scoped on a work machine on 2026-07-29; the build runs on this (home) machine. Nothing has been built yet — begin at Phase 0.

## The one-paragraph version

Store sells premade tumblers, customer-customizable tumblers, and in-house manufactured designs. Blank tumblers are both sellable products AND raw materials (shared stock pool). Selling a customized item consumes component stock via its BOM. "Manufacture Orders" batch-convert components into a finished-good listing (e.g., 12 blanks + glitter → "Pink Glitter Tumbler" with stock 12) and are reversible via per-MO snapshots.

## Hard rules (decided during scoping — do not revisit)

- Components are **WooCommerce products** (flagged, hidden if not sellable) — never a parallel entity.
- BOMs, manufacture orders, and the stock ledger live in **custom tables** (schema in BUILD_PLAN.md §4), not post meta.
- **Every plugin stock change writes a ledger row** and goes through one row-locked `StockService` path using `wc_update_product_stock()`.
- Reversals use **snapshots** (MO item snapshots; `_wcbom_consumed` order-item meta), never re-resolve current BOM.
- Extensibility for new materials (stickers, paint, upgraded straws/caps) = **conditional BOM lines** keyed on variation attributes or add-on values — no code per material.
- Declare **HPOS compatibility**; use WC CRUD only; test blocks + shortcode checkout.

## Conventions

- PHP 8.1+, PSR-4 (`WCBOM\` → `src/`), WPCS-Extra + PHPStan level 6.
- Admin BOM editor / MO screens: React via `@wordpress/scripts`. Everything else PHP.
- Dev env: `wp-env` (Docker) with a seeded tumbler fixture catalog (Phase 0 creates the seed script) — demo every phase against it.
- Text domain: `wcbom`.

## Status / next step

- [ ] Phase 0: wp-env setup, plugin scaffold, tables, fixture seeder
- [ ] Phase 1: ledger + StockService + BOM editor
- [ ] Phase 2: order consumption/restoration
- [ ] Phase 3: phantom (buildable) stock
- [ ] Phase 4: manufacture orders (build/reverse)
- [ ] Phase 5: reports, import/export, REST, CLI
- [ ] Phase 6: hardening, tests, release prep

Update this checklist as phases complete. Remaining open decisions are in BUILD_PLAN.md §11.

**Customizer decision (made 2026-07-29):** variation attributes drive choice-type options (colors/glitter/sizes) with the free "Variation Swatches for WooCommerce" plugin for the UI; free ThemeHigh Extra Product Options (wordpress.org `woo-extra-product-options`) covers text personalization, upgrades, and file uploads. First integration class: `Integrations/ThemeHighEpo.php`. No visual live-preview designer in v1 — if needed later, trial Fancy Product Designer (~$99 one-time) before building anything in-house.
